# Learnings from Week 2 - Day 1 (HTML)

## HTML FUNDAMENTALS 
  talking about the HTML fundamentals, I learned and revised a lot of important things. I understood how every web page starts with a proper structure using the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. I learned the purpose of metadata inside the `<head>` section, like the `<meta charset>` (tells the browser about which character encoding is used) and `<meta viewport>` (this tells mobile browsers how to control the page’s dimensions and scaling) tags, which help with proper character encoding and responsive design. I also practiced using heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs, links, lists, and other text-related elements to organize content clearly. Overall, I gained a stronger understanding of how proper HTML structure and metadata work together to create a well-organized and accessible web page.

## Semantic HTML5
  While learning about Semantic HTML, I created the blog page assigned to me using only semantic HTML elements, without any `<div>` tags. This makes the code readable to developers, search engines, and assistive technologies like screen readers. I learned about `<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, and other related tags.
  Using these tags and attributes, I developed the HTML file for the website so that the structure of the webpage clearly represents its purpose and content.

## Forms and Media
  While learning about forms and media in HTML, I created interactive forms using different input types such as text, email, password, radio buttons, checkboxes, and buttons. I also used `<select>` elements to create dropdown menus and implemented basic form validation to ensure that users provide the correct input before submitting the form. Some of the attributes of input fields used to validate data are: `required` (field must be filled), `type` (checks format like email, number, or URL), `min` and `max` (sets numeric limits), `minlength` and `maxlength` (sets character limits), `pattern` (matches a specific format).
  Additionally, I learned how to embed media such as images, audio, and video using the `<img>`, `<audio>`, and `<video>` tags. Some of the attributes for `<img>`, `<video>`, and `<audio>` tags are: `src` (path to the file), `alt` (alternative text for images), `controls` (show playback controls), `autoplay` (play automatically), `loop` (play repeatedly), `muted` (mute audio/video), `poster` (image shown before video plays), and `width` and `height` (set the size of the media).

## Accessibility
  While learning about accessibility in HTML, I explored ARIA labels, alt text, and tab index. I learned that ARIA labels (aria-) help screen readers understand elements that aren’t clear by default.Some of the attributes for ARIA are: aria-label (adds a label for screen readers), aria-hidden (hides elements from assistive technologies), aria-describedby (provides a description), and aria-required (marks fields as required). Alt text (alt) describes images for users who cannot see them and also helps search engines. Tab index (tabindex) controls the order in which elements are focused when navigating a page using the keyboard. Using these features, I can make web pages more accessible for all users, including those using assistive technologies.

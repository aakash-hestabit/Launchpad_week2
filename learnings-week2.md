## Day 1
On day 1, I got hands-on with semantic HTML5, learning to structure web pages using `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<article>`. I explored forms along with basic validation and accessibility principles to make web pages user-friendly. Additionally, I got introduced to multimedia elements like `<video>`, `<audio>`, and `<canvas>`. Along with all these i created the html structure for a blog page using semantic html only.

      <img src="image.png" alt="preview" width="50%">
      <figcaption>this is the preview of the html structure, it looks so as there is no css applied</figcaption>
    </figure>


## Day 2
  On day 2, I learned about CSS, about various selectors including attribute selectors, sibling selectors. I explored the box model, specificity rules, and units like `rem`, `vw`, and `vh`. I practiced layout techniques using Flexbox and Grid for 2D layouts, and focused on responsive design principles with a mobile-first approach and media queries. Finally, I got hands-on with animations and transitions to make web pages more interactive and visually appealing.
        | Flexbox (Large) | Grid (Large) |

| Flexbox (Medium) | Grid (Medium) |

| Flexbox (Small) | Grid (Small) |

## Day 3
On day 3, I learned JavaScript fundamentals, working with `let` and `const`, arrow functions, and manipulating arrays and objects using methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`. I practiced these concepts through mini-challenges that strengthened my problem-solving skills. I also explored DOM manipulation by building components such as a navbar toggle and dropdown FAQs. Additionally, I used event listeners to create features like a counter and key-based interactions. Als, I built an interactive FAQ accordion where clicking each question expands or collapses the answer.

## Day 4
On this day, I focused on modular JavaScript functions and explored LocalStorage for persisting data across page reloads. I practiced debugging using DevTools breakpoints and watch expressions and built custom JS utilities like debounce, throttle. As a hands-on project, I created a Todo app that persists tasks on refresh using LocalStorage. Additionally, I learned error handling with `try/catch` and implemented an error boundary folder to log errors systematically in `logs/errors.md`.

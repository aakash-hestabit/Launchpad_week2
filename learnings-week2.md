## Day 1
On day 1, I got hands-on with semantic HTML5, learning to structure web pages using `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<article>`. I explored forms along with basic validation and accessibility principles to make web pages user-friendly. Additionally, I got introduced to multimedia elements like `<video>`, `<audio>`, and `<canvas>`. Along with all these i created the html structure for a blog page using semantic html only.
    <figure>
      <img src="image.png" alt="preview" width="50%">
      <figcaption>this is the preview of the html structure, it looks so as there is no css applied</figcaption>
    </figure>


## Day 2
  On day 2, I learned about CSS, about various selectors including attribute selectors, sibling selectors. I explored the box model, specificity rules, and units like `rem`, `vw`, and `vh`. I practiced layout techniques using Flexbox and Grid for 2D layouts, and focused on responsive design principles with a mobile-first approach and media queries. Finally, I got hands-on with animations and transitions to make web pages more interactive and visually appealing.
